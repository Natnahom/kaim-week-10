# Task 1: Defining the Data Analysis Workflow and Understanding the Model and Data
1. Defining the Data Analysis Workflow

a. Steps and Processes for Analyzing Brent Oil Prices Data:

    1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:

        o	Load the historical Brent oil prices dataset.
        o	Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
        o	Convert the Date column to a datetime format.
        o	Ensure the Price column is in a numeric format.

    2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

        o	Visualize the time series data (e.g., line plot of prices over time).
        o	Identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
        o	Analyze the distribution of oil prices.

    3.	Feature Engineering:

        o	Create additional features such as moving averages, price differences, or volatility measures.
        o	Identify and mark key events (e.g., political decisions, conflicts, sanctions, OPEC policy changes) that may have impacted prices.

    4.	Model Selection:

        o	Choose appropriate time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) based on the data characteristics.
        o	Consider Bayesian models (e.g., using PyMC3) for probabilistic inference.
        5.	Model Training and Validation:
        o	Split the data into training and testing sets.
        o	Train the selected models on the training data.
        o	Validate the models using the testing data and evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or AIC.
    6.	Event Impact Analysis:

        o	Analyze the impact of key events on oil prices by comparing price changes before and after the events.
        o	Use statistical tests or Bayesian inference to measure the significance of these impacts.
    7.	Reporting and Visualization:

        o	Generate visualizations (e.g., time series plots, event impact plots).
        o	Prepare a report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.

b. Understanding Data Generation, Sampling, and Compilation:

    •	The dataset contains daily Brent oil prices from May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022.
    •	The data is likely sampled from market transactions and compiled by a financial or energy data provider.
    •	The dataset is time-series data, where each observation is dependent on previous observations.

c. Model Inputs, Parameters, and Outputs:

    •	Inputs: Historical Brent oil prices, key event dates, and any additional features (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
    •	Parameters: Model-specific parameters (e.g., ARIMA parameters (p, d, q), GARCH parameters (p, q)).
    •	Outputs: Predicted oil prices, event impact analysis, and probabilistic forecasts.

d. Assumptions and Limitations:

    •	Assumptions:
        o	The time series is stationary (or can be made stationary through differencing).
        o	Key events have a measurable impact on oil prices.
        o	The chosen models adequately capture the underlying data generation process.
        •	Limitations:
        o	The analysis is limited to the available historical data and may not account for future unprecedented events.
        o	The impact of events may be confounded by other factors not included in the dataset.
        o	The models may not fully capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

e. Media Channels and Formats for Communicating Results:

    •	Reports: Detailed PDF reports with visualizations and insights.
    •	Presentations: Slide decks for stakeholders, summarizing key findings.
    •	Dashboards: Interactive dashboards (e.g., using Tableau or Power BI) for real-time data exploration.
    •	Email Updates: Regular email updates with key insights and forecasts.

2. Understanding the Model and Data

a. Key Concepts and Models:
    •	ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A model that captures temporal dependencies in time series data. It is defined by parameters (p, d, q) where:
        o	p is the number of autoregressive terms.
        o	d is the degree of differencing.
        o	q is the number of moving average terms.
    •	GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity): A model that captures volatility clustering in time series data. It is useful for modeling the variance of the series over time.
    •	Bayesian Models: These models use probabilistic inference to estimate parameters and make predictions. PyMC3 is a Python library for Bayesian modeling, allowing for flexible model specification and inference using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) methods.

b. Purpose and Application of Models:
    •	ARIMA: Used to model and forecast time series data by capturing trends and seasonality.
    •	GARCH: Used to model and forecast volatility, which is crucial for risk management in financial markets.
    •	Bayesian Models: Provide a probabilistic framework for understanding uncertainty in predictions and parameter estimates.

c. Data Generation Processes:
    •	The Brent oil prices are generated by market transactions influenced by supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and macroeconomic factors.
    •	Time series models like ARIMA and GARCH aim to capture these underlying processes by modeling the temporal dependencies and volatility in the data.

d. Expected Outputs and Limitations:
    •	Expected Outputs:
        o	Forecasted oil prices with confidence intervals.
        o	Quantified impact of key events on oil prices.
        o	Insights into the drivers of oil price fluctuations.
        •	Limitations:
        o	Models may not capture sudden, unprecedented events (e.g., black swan events).
        o	The quality of predictions depends on the quality and granularity of the data.
        o	Models may require frequent updating as new data becomes available.
