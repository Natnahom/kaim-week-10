# Task 1: Defining the Data Analysis Workflow and Understanding the Model and Data
1. Defining the Data Analysis Workflow

a. Steps and Processes for Analyzing Brent Oil Prices Data:

    1.	Data Collection and Preprocessing:

        o	Load the historical Brent oil prices dataset.
        o	Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
        o	Convert the Date column to a datetime format.
        o	Ensure the Price column is in a numeric format.

    2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

        o	Visualize the time series data (e.g., line plot of prices over time).
        o	Identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
        o	Analyze the distribution of oil prices.

    3.	Feature Engineering:

        o	Create additional features such as moving averages, price differences, or volatility measures.
        o	Identify and mark key events (e.g., political decisions, conflicts, sanctions, OPEC policy changes) that may have impacted prices.

    4.	Model Selection:

        o	Choose appropriate time series models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) based on the data characteristics.
        o	Consider Bayesian models (e.g., using PyMC3) for probabilistic inference.
        5.	Model Training and Validation:
        o	Split the data into training and testing sets.
        o	Train the selected models on the training data.
        o	Validate the models using the testing data and evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or AIC.
    6.	Event Impact Analysis:

        o	Analyze the impact of key events on oil prices by comparing price changes before and after the events.
        o	Use statistical tests or Bayesian inference to measure the significance of these impacts.
    7.	Reporting and Visualization:

        o	Generate visualizations (e.g., time series plots, event impact plots).
        o	Prepare a report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.

b. Understanding Data Generation, Sampling, and Compilation:

    •	The dataset contains daily Brent oil prices from May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022.
    •	The data is likely sampled from market transactions and compiled by a financial or energy data provider.
    •	The dataset is time-series data, where each observation is dependent on previous observations.

c. Model Inputs, Parameters, and Outputs:

    •	Inputs: Historical Brent oil prices, key event dates, and any additional features (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
    •	Parameters: Model-specific parameters (e.g., ARIMA parameters (p, d, q), GARCH parameters (p, q)).
    •	Outputs: Predicted oil prices, event impact analysis, and probabilistic forecasts.

d. Assumptions and Limitations:

    •	Assumptions:
        o	The time series is stationary (or can be made stationary through differencing).
        o	Key events have a measurable impact on oil prices.
        o	The chosen models adequately capture the underlying data generation process.
        •	Limitations:
        o	The analysis is limited to the available historical data and may not account for future unprecedented events.
        o	The impact of events may be confounded by other factors not included in the dataset.
        o	The models may not fully capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

e. Media Channels and Formats for Communicating Results:

    •	Reports: Detailed PDF reports with visualizations and insights.
    •	Presentations: Slide decks for stakeholders, summarizing key findings.
    •	Dashboards: Interactive dashboards (e.g., using Tableau or Power BI) for real-time data exploration.
    •	Email Updates: Regular email updates with key insights and forecasts.

2. Understanding the Model and Data

a. Key Concepts and Models:
    •	ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A model that captures temporal dependencies in time series data. It is defined by parameters (p, d, q) where:
        o	p is the number of autoregressive terms.
        o	d is the degree of differencing.
        o	q is the number of moving average terms.
    •	GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity): A model that captures volatility clustering in time series data. It is useful for modeling the variance of the series over time.
    •	Bayesian Models: These models use probabilistic inference to estimate parameters and make predictions. PyMC3 is a Python library for Bayesian modeling, allowing for flexible model specification and inference using MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) methods.

b. Purpose and Application of Models:
    •	ARIMA: Used to model and forecast time series data by capturing trends and seasonality.
    •	GARCH: Used to model and forecast volatility, which is crucial for risk management in financial markets.
    •	Bayesian Models: Provide a probabilistic framework for understanding uncertainty in predictions and parameter estimates.

c. Data Generation Processes:
    •	The Brent oil prices are generated by market transactions influenced by supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and macroeconomic factors.
    •	Time series models like ARIMA and GARCH aim to capture these underlying processes by modeling the temporal dependencies and volatility in the data.

d. Expected Outputs and Limitations:
    •	Expected Outputs:
        o	Forecasted oil prices with confidence intervals.
        o	Quantified impact of key events on oil prices.
        o	Insights into the drivers of oil price fluctuations.
        •	Limitations:
        o	Models may not capture sudden, unprecedented events (e.g., black swan events).
        o	The quality of predictions depends on the quality and granularity of the data.
        o	Models may require frequent updating as new data becomes available.

# Task 2: Time Series Model Development and Evaluation
## Overview
In this task, we aim to develop and evaluate multiple models for predicting oil prices, specifically focusing on Brent crude oil prices. The objective is to explore different modeling techniques, which include traditional time series models, econometric models, and machine learning algorithms. We will also compare the performance of these models using various evaluation metrics.

## Objectives
- Model Development: Implement different types of models to predict Brent crude oil prices.
- Time Series Models: Such as ARIMA and SARIMA, which capture temporal dependencies in the data.
- Econometric Models: Including linear regression, which can incorporate external variables and trends.
- Machine Learning Models: Such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, which can capture complex relationships in the data.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model based on multiple metrics.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual values.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Provides the average error in absolute terms, giving an idea of how far off predictions are on average.
- R-squared: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.
- Comparison of Models: Create a framework to compare the performance of all models on the same dataset using the defined metrics.

## Data Preparation
- Data Collection
The dataset will typically include historical Brent crude oil prices along with relevant features such as dates. It is crucial to ensure that the data is clean and preprocessed before building any models. This includes:

- Handling missing values.
Transforming date columns to appropriate formats.
Creating lagged variables for time series analysis.
Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a critical step in the modeling process:

- Lagged Variables: Creating lagged versions of the target variable (e.g., previous day's price) to help models understand trends.
- Date Features: Converting date columns into numerical formats (e.g., timestamps) to make them usable for regression models.
Model Implementation
Time Series Models

**ARIMA:**

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a widely used time series forecasting method that combines autoregression, differencing, and moving averages. It is suitable for univariate time series data that shows patterns over time.
SARIMA:

Seasonal ARIMA extends ARIMA by adding seasonal components, making it suitable for data with seasonal patterns.
Econometric Models

**Linear Regression:**

A simple yet powerful approach that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It can include lagged variables and other features to improve predictive accuracy.
Machine Learning Models

**Random Forest:**

An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification or mean prediction for regression. It is robust to overfitting and can handle non-linear relationships.
Gradient Boosting:

Another ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, where each model attempts to correct the errors of the previous ones. It often yields high accuracy but may require careful tuning of parameters.
Model Evaluation and Comparison
After fitting the models, we will evaluate their performance using the defined metrics. The evaluation process will involve:

Making predictions on a holdout dataset.
Calculating RMSE, MAE, and R-squared for each model.
Creating a comparison table to summarize the metrics for all models.
